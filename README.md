# LiveAPI
Successful apps are built on data. As developers, we don’t always have access to the data that would help make our app successful. While the internet is a nearly-bottomless source of public data in the form of websites, that data is not always structured or available programmatically through an API. Time spent building an extraction algorithm and server is time not spent building your app.

We’re developing LiveAPI, a developer tool to turn any website’s public data into an API in a few minutes. LiveAPI has two parts: a Chrome Extension to select data to extract and a user-hostable server that extracts data and serves up the user-created API endpoints.

The following three-part guide that walks through how to get started and use LiveAPI.
